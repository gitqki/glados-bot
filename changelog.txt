Changelog Version 0.2
---------------------

fixes:
- fixed an issue when config.json wasnt loaded correctly (import * as CONFIG from "src")
- fixed and issue when classes weren't loaded correctly (removed .ts)

changes:
- config.json is now at "root/src/config"


new:
- Outsourced all neccessary stuff for better structure
- gladosBot.ts just act like a handler, who calls all the features
- created some classes for different stuff like no prefix commands, with prefix commands and stuff.
- bot can't call own commands anymore

still in development:
- implemented a feature, which allows to post play comments (everything after .play ?play..) in other channels, to implement songname lists
we need a filter, which search for existing songnames in the channel. (channel atm: test)
